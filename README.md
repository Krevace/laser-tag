# Arduino Laser Tag

During my junior year at CHC, I was in the robotics class, a do-anything project-based class. This was the second of four total projects. Coming after Ukelele Hero, I wanted something much similar, so I opted to make a proof-of-concept Arduino laser tag gun. While the final construction looked a little janky (just a prototype) it worked just as expected.
